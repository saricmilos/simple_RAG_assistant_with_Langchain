    "# Build an AI Chatbot with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Milos Saric [https://saricmilos.com/]  \n",
    "**Date:** January 15, 2026  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the thing: most “how-to” guides start with the same line: *“Grab your OpenAI API key and add a credit card.”*  \n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you **don’t want to pay**? Maybe you’re a student. Maybe you hate hitting rate limits. Or maybe you just want a chatbot that runs locally, offline, and respects your privacy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Good news: it’s possible. In this guide, we’ll show you how to build a chatbot using **LangChain, React, and TypeScript**—with **zero cloud dependencies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How AI Usually Works — APIs and Tokens Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an **API** as a waiter in a restaurant:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You ask the app: *“What’s the capital of France?”*  \n",
    "2. The waiter (API) delivers your request to the kitchen (the AI).  \n",
    "3. The kitchen cooks up an answer.  \n",
    "4. The waiter brings it back: *“Paris!”*\n",
    "\n",
    "With OpenAI, your computer doesn’t do the thinking. Everything happens on OpenAI’s servers. The smarter the AI, the more expensive the “meal.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Tokens Matter — Every Word Has a Price\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of each word as a **puzzle piece**. The AI puts the pieces together to understand and respond:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Short phrases: just a couple of pieces.  \n",
    "- Complex sentences: 10–15 pieces or more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Every puzzle piece = **token**. APIs like OpenAI charge for tokens, not messages. That’s why long chats or memory-enabled bots get expensive fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s a Token, Exactly?\n",
    "\n",
    "A token is basically a chunk of text:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"Hello\"` → 1 token  \n",
    "- `\"Artificial Intelligence is awesome\"` → ~5–6 tokens  \n",
    "- A full conversation → hundreds of tokens  \n",
    "- Upload a document → thousands of tokens  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example conversation (roughly 50–80 tokens):\n",
    "\n",
    "**User:** \"Hi, I can't log in to my account\"  \n",
    "**Bot:** \"I can help! What error message are you seeing?\"  \n",
    "**User:** \"'Invalid credentials,' but my password is correct\"  \n",
    "**Bot:** \"Got it. Let's try some troubleshooting steps...\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiply that by hundreds of users, and token costs can explode—even at just $0.002 per 1K tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hidden Costs of Relying on Paid APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Even beyond token fees, there are other downsides:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling Costs\n",
    "- Testing & development: ~$50/month  \n",
    "- Small business: $200–500/month  \n",
    "- Enterprise: $2,000–10,000+/month  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Infrastructure & Reliability\n",
    "- Your app breaks if the API goes down  \n",
    "- Latency slows the experience  \n",
    "- Constant internet connection required  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Privacy Risks\n",
    "- All data goes through a third-party server  \n",
    "- You can’t control retention policies  \n",
    "- Compliance issues for sensitive industries  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Service Limits\n",
    "- Rate limits throttle usage  \n",
    "- Outages leave users stranded  \n",
    "- Price changes can break your model  \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, this is where you’d start reaching for your wallet. But in this guide, **we’ll avoid all of it**.\n"

    "# What is LangChain, Really?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is an **open-source framework** built to help developers create AI applications that are **context-aware, reasoning-capable, and able to use external tools**. The twist? You **don’t have to rely on cloud APIs** to make it work.  \n",

    "Think of LangChain like **LEGO for AI**. You get different “blocks” that you can snap together:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Language Model blocks** – the brain of your AI  \n",
    "- **Memory blocks** – to remember conversations  \n",
    "- **Tool blocks** – calculators, web search, file access  \n",
    "- **Logic blocks** – decision-making and reasoning  \n",
    "- **Data blocks** – document search, databases  \n",
    "\n",
    "Whether your “brain” is **GPT-4**, a **local model like LLaMA**, or something running entirely on your machine, LangChain helps you assemble all the pieces into a functioning chatbot.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why LangChain is Special\n",
    "\n",
    "Using LangChain with **local or open-source models** gives you benefits you can’t get with cloud APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ No API key required  \n",
    "- ✅ No token limits – chat freely  \n",
    "- ✅ No unexpected bills – completely free after setup  \n",
    "- ✅ Full privacy – nothing leaves your computer  \n",
    "- ✅ Works offline – no internet needed  \n",
    "- ✅ Total control – fully customizable  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use LangChain? (The Big Deal)\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain isn’t just about saving money—it’s about **flexibility, power, and simplicity**. Whether you’re a student, beginner, or seasoned developer, here’s why it’s a game-changer:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Simplified Development\n",
    "LangChain removes the headache of writing all the low-level code yourself. It handles **connecting models, managing prompts, and storing memory** so you can focus on what your AI should actually do. Think of it as a **pre-built toolbox for AI**, ready to go.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Modular and Flexible Architecture\n",
    "Remember those LEGO blocks? That’s the core of LangChain’s design.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Swap out models or tools with a few lines of code  \n",
    "- Add new data sources easily  \n",
    "- Experiment and iterate faster than ever  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Context Awareness and Memory\n",
    "A good chatbot remembers the conversation. LangChain comes with **built-in memory management**, so your AI keeps track of previous turns, creating **more natural and helpful interactions**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Agentic Capabilities\n",
    "This is where LangChain shines for advanced AI:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Build AI **agents** that can reason and make decisions  \n",
    "- Use tools automatically: search the web, run calculations, execute code  \n",
    "- Create **multi-step workflows** where the AI can actually solve problems, not just answer questions  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Community and Ecosystem\n",
    "Even though it’s relatively new, LangChain has a **growing and supportive community**. Tutorials, examples, and resources are abundant. If you get stuck, chances are someone else has faced the same problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "# Building a RAG Chatbot with LangChain and OLLAMA APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are incredibly powerful—they can write essays, answer questions, and even get creative—but they have one key limitation: **their knowledge is static**. That means they can sometimes give outdated or incorrect answers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, we can use **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**. RAG systems connect an LLM to **external data sources**, allowing the AI to fetch accurate, up-to-date information before generating a response.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Accept documents in **TXT, PDF, CSV, or DOCX** formats  \n",
    "- Retrieve relevant content from your uploaded documents  \n",
    "- Provide **accurate, context-aware answers** to your questions by sending the retrieved data to the LLM  \n",
    "\n",
    "This setup ensures your chatbot isn’t just guessing—it **leverages your documents to give correct answers**.  \n",

    "## How the RAG System Works\n",
    "\n",
    "We broke the system down into its main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Loader** – Reads and parses your uploaded files  \n",
    "2. **Vector Store / Embeddings** – Converts documents into a format that’s easy for the chatbot to search  \n",
    "3. **Retriever** – Finds the most relevant pieces of your documents based on your question  \n",
    "4. **Conversational Retrieval Chain** – Combines the retrieved content with your question and passes it to the LLM for an accurate response  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the system interactive, we built a **React-based UI**. Users can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upload documents  \n",
    "- Ask questions about the content  \n",
    "- Receive precise answers generated by the RAG-powered LLM  \n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a **seamless chat experience** where the AI is directly informed by your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "## <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"text_splitters\">Text Splitters</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Text splitters are tools that divide large documents into smaller sections, or **chunks**, that fit within a model's context window. Since language models can only process a limited number of tokens at a time, splitting text effectively is crucial for maintaining context and ensuring high-quality responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **LangChain**, text can be split in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **By tokens** – divides text based on the number of tokens used by the model.  \n",
    "- **By characters** – splits text according to character counts.  \n",
    "- **By code structure** – specialized splitters exist for programming languages like Java, JavaScript, and PHP, allowing chunks to respect logical code blocks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Splitter for General Text\n",
    "\n",
    "For most text documents, it is recommended to use the **[RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/recursive_text_splitter)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it works:**  \n",
    "  The splitter uses a **list of characters or strings** (for example, `\"\\n\\n\"`, `\"\\n\"`, `\" \"`) in a specific order to recursively divide the text. It continues splitting until each chunk is small enough to fit within the model’s context window.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why it’s effective:**  \n",
    "  This method preserves **semantic relationships** between paragraphs, sentences, and words by keeping related content together as much as possible. Instead of splitting arbitrarily, it prioritizes meaningful boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chunk Overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure consistency and improve context retention, a **small overlap** between consecutive chunks is recommended. This means that some content at the end of one chunk is repeated at the start of the next.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefits:**  \n",
    "  - Helps the model maintain context across chunks.  \n",
    "  - Reduces the chance of losing important information between splits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By using a proper text splitter and overlap, you can maximize the usefulness of documents in **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** workflows and other applications requiring structured text input.\n"

    "### Contextual Compression\n",
    "\n",
    "When using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), **retrieved documents often contain irrelevant information** that is unrelated to the user’s query. Passing all of this information to a language model can be **costly and reduce accuracy**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> In high-stakes enterprise RAG systems, **more data often means more noise**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "- Suppose a retrieved document chunk is **1,600 characters**, but only **200 characters are relevant** to the query.  \n",
    "- Sending the entire chunk to the model means paying for **1,400 characters of unnecessary content**, which may **distract the model** and reduce answer quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contextual Compression** solves this problem by:  \n",
    "- Extracting only the **“meat”**—the portions of the document that are **directly relevant** to the user’s query.  \n",
    "- Passing a **concise, focused summary** to the model instead of the full chunk.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach leads to:  \n",
    "- **Lower costs** (fewer tokens processed by the LLM)  \n",

    "\n",
    "### How the Contextual Compression Retriever Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Retrieval:**  \n",
    "   The user query is first passed to a **base retriever** (typically a vectorstore-backed retriever) which returns an initial set of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Document Compression:**  \n",
    "   The retrieved documents are then passed through a **Document Compressor**, which either reduces the content or removes irrelevant documents entirely.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The document compressor can make an [LLM call](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/contextual_compression#adding-contextual-compression-with-an-llmchainextractor) to perform **contextual compression** on each document.  \n",
    "> ⚠️ This approach can be slow and costly if done on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficient Alternative: Document Compressor Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of compressing entire documents directly, we can use a **Document Compressor Pipeline** to process documents more efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split Documents into Chunks:**  \n",
    "   Use `CharacterTextSplitter` to break each document into smaller chunks (e.g., chunk size = 500 characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Remove Redundant Chunks:**  \n",
    "   Apply `EmbeddingsRedundantFilter` to filter out overlapping or repeated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Select Most Relevant Chunks:**  \n",
    "   Use `EmbeddingsFilter` to pick the chunks most relevant to the query based on a **similarity threshold** and **k parameter**.  \n",
    "   - For example, set `k = 16` to select the top 16 chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reorder Chunks for LLM Efficiency:**  \n",
    "   Use `LongContextReorder` to arrange the chunks so that the **most relevant elements appear at the top and bottom** of the list.  \n",
    "   - This ordering improves LLM performance and helps the model focus on key information first.  \n",
    "   - More details in the [Long Context paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172).\n",

    "Retrieval is the process of taking a user query and finding the most relevant information from a collection of documents. So far, we have looked at the individual steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the data** – bringing in the documents from a source, whether it’s a local file, database, or vectorstore.\n",
    "2. **Embedding the query** – converting the user’s query into a vector representation that can be compared to document vectors.\n",
    "3. **Finding similar documents** – using a base retriever to identify documents whose embeddings are closest to the query embedding.\n",
    "4. **Reordering and filtering** – applying techniques like semantic reranking, redundancy filtering, and contextual reordering to ensure the results are the most relevant and concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together means combining these steps into a single retrieval pipeline. A query goes into the system, the retriever fetches candidate documents, and any compressors or rerankers refine the results. The final output is a ranked list of documents that are both relevant and contextually optimized, ready to be used for tasks like answering questions, generating summaries, or feeding into an LLM."
