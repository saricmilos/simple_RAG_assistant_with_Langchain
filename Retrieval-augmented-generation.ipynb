    "# Build an AI Chatbot with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Milos Saric [https://saricmilos.com/]  \n",
    "**Date:** January 15, 2026  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the thing: most “how-to” guides start with the same line: *“Grab your OpenAI API key and add a credit card.”*  \n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you **don’t want to pay**? Maybe you’re a student. Maybe you hate hitting rate limits. Or maybe you just want a chatbot that runs locally, offline, and respects your privacy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Good news: it’s possible. In this guide, we’ll show you how to build a chatbot using **LangChain, React, and TypeScript**—with **zero cloud dependencies**.\n",

    "## How AI Usually Works — APIs and Tokens Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an **API** as a waiter in a restaurant:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You ask the app: *“What’s the capital of France?”*  \n",
    "2. The waiter (API) delivers your request to the kitchen (the AI).  \n",
    "3. The kitchen cooks up an answer.  \n",
    "4. The waiter brings it back: *“Paris!”*\n",
    "\n",
    "With OpenAI, your computer doesn’t do the thinking. Everything happens on OpenAI’s servers. The smarter the AI, the more expensive the “meal.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Tokens Matter — Every Word Has a Price\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of each word as a **puzzle piece**. The AI puts the pieces together to understand and respond:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Short phrases: just a couple of pieces.  \n",
    "- Complex sentences: 10–15 pieces or more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Every puzzle piece = **token**. APIs like OpenAI charge for tokens, not messages. That’s why long chats or memory-enabled bots get expensive fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s a Token, Exactly?\n",
    "\n",
    "A token is basically a chunk of text:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"Hello\"` → 1 token  \n",
    "- `\"Artificial Intelligence is awesome\"` → ~5–6 tokens  \n",
    "- A full conversation → hundreds of tokens  \n",
    "- Upload a document → thousands of tokens  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example conversation (roughly 50–80 tokens):\n",
    "\n",
    "**User:** \"Hi, I can't log in to my account\"  \n",
    "**Bot:** \"I can help! What error message are you seeing?\"  \n",
    "**User:** \"'Invalid credentials,' but my password is correct\"  \n",
    "**Bot:** \"Got it. Let's try some troubleshooting steps...\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiply that by hundreds of users, and token costs can explode—even at just $0.002 per 1K tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hidden Costs of Relying on Paid APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Even beyond token fees, there are other downsides:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling Costs\n",
    "- Testing & development: ~$50/month  \n",
    "- Small business: $200–500/month  \n",
    "- Enterprise: $2,000–10,000+/month  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Infrastructure & Reliability\n",
    "- Your app breaks if the API goes down  \n",
    "- Latency slows the experience  \n",
    "- Constant internet connection required  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Privacy Risks\n",
    "- All data goes through a third-party server  \n",
    "- You can’t control retention policies  \n",
    "- Compliance issues for sensitive industries  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Service Limits\n",
    "- Rate limits throttle usage  \n",
    "- Outages leave users stranded  \n",
    "- Price changes can break your model  \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, this is where you’d start reaching for your wallet. But in this guide, **we’ll avoid all of it**.\n"
