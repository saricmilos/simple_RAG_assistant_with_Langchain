## 1. What Is a Chatbot?

A chatbot is a software system designed to simulate human-like conversations via text or voice interfaces. Modern chatbots:

* Understand natural language
* Maintain conversational context across multi-turn dialogues
* Generate accurate, context-aware responses in real time
* Integrate deeply with internal business systems and workflows

Unlike traditional scripted bots, our solutions leverage **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **advanced retrieval mechanisms** to ensure responses are:

* Relevant
* Up-to-date
* Grounded in verified internal data
* Auditable and compliant with business standards

**Deliverables/Artifacts:**

* Chatbot architecture diagram
* Capability and limitation matrix
* Integration and dependency map

## 2. RAG-Powered Chatbots

### 2.1 What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**RAG** combines **information retrieval** with **generative AI**. Key benefits include:

* Reduced hallucinations
* Responses grounded in trusted company-approved content
* Multi-document reasoning and context-aware answers
* Transparent and auditable output

**Core Principle:** RAG retrieves relevant information from curated sources and uses it to inform LLM-generated responses.

### 2.2 How Our RAG Chatbots Work

**Structured Pipeline:**

1. **User query analysis** and intent detection
2. **Semantic retrieval** of relevant documents/chunks
3. **Context assembly** and relevance ranking
4. **LLM-based response generation** grounded in retrieved content
5. **Optional validation, citation, or backend action execution**

**Artifacts:**

* RAG pipeline diagram
* Retrieval scoring and ranking metrics
* Prompt and response libraries
