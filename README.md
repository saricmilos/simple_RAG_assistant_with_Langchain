# Chatbot Services Overview

## What Is a Chatbot?

A chatbot is a software system designed to simulate human-like conversations through text or voice interfaces. Modern chatbots go far beyond simple rule-based flows and are capable of understanding natural language, maintaining conversational context, and generating accurate, helpful responses in real time.

At Cassiopeia Intelligence, we focus on **production-grade chatbots** that integrate deeply with business systems, knowledge bases, and workflows. Our chatbots are designed to deliver consistent, reliable answers while operating at scale and with minimal human intervention.

Unlike traditional scripted bots, our solutions leverage large language models (LLMs) and advanced retrieval mechanisms to ensure responses are relevant, up-to-date, and grounded in verified business data.

## RAG-Powered Chatbots

### What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architecture that combines information retrieval with generative AI. Instead of relying solely on a model’s internal knowledge, RAG systems retrieve relevant information from curated data sources and use it to generate accurate, context-aware responses.

This approach significantly reduces hallucinations and ensures that chatbot answers are based on trusted, company-approved content.

### How Our RAG Chatbots Work

Our RAG-powered chatbots follow a structured pipeline:

1. User query analysis and intent detection
2. Semantic retrieval of relevant documents or data chunks
3. Context assembly and ranking
4. LLM-based response generation grounded in retrieved content
5. Optional citation, validation, or action execution

This architecture allows chatbots to answer complex questions while remaining transparent, auditable, and maintainable.

### Key Capabilities
